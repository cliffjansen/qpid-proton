raw_plus_tls.c : existing API based example that bolts TLS processing
on top of an application that uses pn_raw_connection_t IO.  TBD:
proper error handling and tracing, sessions, perhaps close/shutdown.

sketch.h : a rough sketch of an alternate API provided by Andrew
Stitcher.  One main difference is that this API allows the pn_tls_t
instance to temporarily own raw buffers.  The advantage is that the
instance now does no self buffering other than via the buffers
provided by the application.  Also, encrypt and decrypt operations do
not require managing "equal enough" sets of input and output buffers.
Instead you put in a bunch of raw buffers to be processed and later
extract the result buffers (based on prior or subsequent supply of
result buffers).
